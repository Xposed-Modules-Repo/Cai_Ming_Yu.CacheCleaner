# 彩銘羽 CacheCleaner
ソフトウェアが起動したら、まずキャッシュをクリアする！

This repo is exactly the same as [this one](https://github.com/Cai-Ming-Yu/CMY-CacheCleaner).

Use Xposed to clear the software's cache data when it starts.

## Env
- LSPosed or any other framework that can use the Xposed module is installed

## How to use
Install the latest version of the Xposed module released [here](https://github.com/Cai-Ming-Yu/Cai_Ming_Yu.CacheCleaner/releases), or package it into other software via frameworks such as LSPatch.

If you are not packaging into other software using a tool like LSPatch, enable this module in an Xposed framework like LSPosed and select the required software.
